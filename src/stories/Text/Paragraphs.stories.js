                This is <b>paragraph P1</b>. Our whole universe was in a hot dense state, then nearly fourteen billion
                years ago expansion started. Wait... The Earth began to cool, the autotrophs began to drool.
                Neanderthals developed tools, we built a wall (we built the pyramids). Math, science, history,
                unraveling the mysteries, that all started with the big bang!

                This is <b>paragraph P2</b>. There are those who believe that life here began out there... far across
                the universe, with tribes of humans who may have been the forefathers of the Egyptians or the Toltecs or
                the Mayans. Some believe that there may yet be brothers of man who even now fight to survive somewhere
                beyond the heavens. Fleeing from the Cylon Tyranny, the last Battlestar - Galactica - leads a rag-tag
                fugitive fleet on a lonely quest. A shining planet, known as Earth.

                ranger's hair. At a picnic table you will find him there, stuffing down more goodies than the average
                bear. He will sleep till noon but before it's dark, he'll have every picnic basket that's in Jellystone
                Park. Yogi has it better than a millionaire. That's because he's smarter than the average bear!
