## Welcome to the Xola UI/Frontend Kit

This UI Kit is a suite of pre-built React components that conform to Xola's design style and brand guidelines which are set by Xola's designer. These include things like alerts, avatars, modals, tooltips and even various input fields and other form elements.


This UI Kit was created to ensure consistent, best practice and prevent bad code. It has sensible UI design and a friendly development experience by reducing the time you need to spend working on configuring the UX of a component. Everything you see here was built from scratch for the new Xola V2 design.

Click on each component on the right to check out it's design. Click on *"Docs"* in the top toolbar to look at it's configuration parameters which can be tried out live! Click *"Show Code"* in those boxes to see how to use that component.
