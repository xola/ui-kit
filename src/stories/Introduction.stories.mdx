## Welcome to the Xola UI Kit

This UI Kit is a suite of React components & helper libraries that conform to Xola's design style and brand guidelines which are set by Xola's design team. Components like alerts, avatars, modals, tooltips etc.

The UI Kit ensures consistent & best practices. It has a friendly development experience by reducing the time you need to spend working on configuring the UX of a component. Everything you see here was built from scratch for the new Xola V2 design.

Click on each component on the left to view it's design. Click on _"Docs"_ in the top toolbar to look at it's configuration parameters which can be tried out live! Click _"Show Code"_ in those boxes to see how to use that component.
